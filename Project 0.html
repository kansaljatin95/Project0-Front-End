    Dear me,
    <p> A month ago i didnt knew much about programming and web development.But then i encountered something named udacity providing quality education.I joined it a month ago and my journey during this was filled with ups and downs.I learned one thing that giving up isnt a solution.I will go through many mental outburts at times and at once it will be like "i just cant do it".To solve this problem i will make a time table first with proper planning.Through this i will do everything and never feel that since i am into it i am unable to do basic things in my life.Whenever i will feel uncontrolable,i will take a nap and come up fresh will old enthusiasm.</p><br>
    <p>Talking about the skills i dont have much of it.I am just a mere beginner in this field and i aim to grow more and more but one skill i have for sure of not giving up no matter what happens.I have learned html and javascript basics being a course of syllabus in my computer science degree.So surely i will use these techniques to tackle problems at times.</p><br>
    <p>My future goals are to learn the management skills of  company and learning all basic work needed to be a developer so as to someday start my own startup. </p>
    <p><b><h2>I have some queries regarding future scope of front-end as it seems quite obvious that front end means the things we are able to see on screen and these days there are so many websites providing websites for free with full front and back end support and google templates providing fascnating things to make a website in matter of hours.So where do i stand after 5 yrs in front end developing?? </b></h2></p>
